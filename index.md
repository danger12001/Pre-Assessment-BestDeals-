# The Best of Deals

## Avo, is it me youâ€™re looking for?

> Use JavaScript to: parse strings and convert them to numbers; loop through an array; compare the result of calculations.

We want to find the best place to buy some avocados. We like avocados because they are green. The supermarket has a set of different, slightly odd, offers for avos. A friend of ours has been hanging, staring at them, and has sent us this message:

```
"1 for R3, 2 for R7, 3 for R 10, 5 for R14.50."
```

Use this string as your starting point. Use TDD and write functions that:

* convert the string into an array (split out the quantity and the price);
* take an array as an input and calculate the Price Per Avo for each deal (make sure you use just two decimal points);
* find the cheapest deal;
* find the most expensive deal;
* find the average price across all the deals.
